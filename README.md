# 100-Days-Of-Python

Hiya there! I have always enjoyed coding and being able to use data for my projects. Since I am hoping to start a new role in January 2023, I thought that this would be a great time for me to start Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code course on UDemy and finally start my quest of learning the magnificient Python language :)
